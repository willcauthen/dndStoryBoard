Marvin/Barvin

**************************************************
The party starts out arrayed before Marvin/Barvin.
**************************************************


You have been assembled because we've been told you can get things done. Each of you has been selected and gathered to take part in a mission of high-risk, for which we are offering high-reward.
It is my understanding you few may not have not yet have had the pleasure of sharing introductions. There will be time for later. The mission is dangerous, and so we have taken the liberty of assembling what we believe to be a well-rounded team, equipped to handle the task at hand.

	My uncle, Zaryngarth, has been missing for a few years. While he has been known to disappear for weeks at a time in the past, we have reason to believe he has met a tragic demise in the outer realms.

	My uncle was a bit of an eccentric, and was known to keep strange habbits and stranger company. Now, we have just recieved legal permissions to acquire his effects and holdings. It has been a long time since anyone has seen Zaryngarth, and longer still since anyone we can confirm has visited his estate. Your mission, is to locate his domain, take inventory as best you can of any property that may be of value, and return to me a report of what you find.

	Because we do not know what you'll find, and because the road is long, we have put together the team you know find yourselves a part of. If you choose the accept my offer, I will give you for the mission a key to Zaryngarth's estate, and a map to lead you there. It's just over a day's journey north-east.

	Upon delivery of your report, if you all return alive, I will pay you each 100gp. Otherwise, I will pay each of those that return 50gp. I find this gives adventurers incentive to work together, and stay focused, rather than stab each other in the back for personal gain. Are there questions?


	P.S. Please make sure to give the house a thorough inspection, but remain cautious. My Uncle maintained some, strange, proclivities.

		Zaryn is a crotchedy human, who has spent his twilight years communing with devils, and other dark powers. He is/was a hierarch of secretive snake cult, who worships somegodorother. Human sacrifice, rituals, and magical experimentation. He has been working as something of a patsy between Devils and the Snake god, working some kind of clandestine smuggling operation between the evil powers.

		The adventurers are set to arrive in the midst of a such a dealing. Zaryn summons, and temporarily binds and Demon from The Abyss and intends to sacrifice the creature to his snake god, when the adventurers (or the other thieves sent by Marvin/Barvin) interupt the wizards concentration, allowing the devil to break free.
		Once free, the devil goes on a rampage. It vaporizes/devours/rips apart Zaryn, but if it sees a group of people, it will try to escape into the world.

LEAVING THE TOWN


THE ROAD
Either one challenging predator, or two semi-challenging humanoids on the road. Some smaller stuff along the way. Maybe a traveling trader or something, offering snake oil, and a baubble from a far off land. Maybe said baubble would come in handy if the PCs bought or stole it??

Should be a place to make camp//rent a room nearer to the Mushroom Castle.



THE MUSHROOM CASTLE

Probably three floors. One might need levitation? One underground? Underground chamber has summoning chamber where Zaryn has been hard at work for several days. The PCs find he's opened a gate to Hell, and is in the midst of binding a demon/devil. While they are observing this, from further down the chamber two other theives (also hired by Marvin/Barvin) stumble into the chamber, scarring the shit out of Zaryn, which breaks his concentration on the ritual, which then allows the demon/devil to gruesomesomely kill Zaryn, and then try to flee or get reabsorbed by the gate.

All around there should be smatterings of skeletons, slimes, a mimic, and random loot in corners and such. Hidden doors, maybe?
