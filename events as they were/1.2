Drogon enters the moss. Halfway down, the moss disintegrates, revealing a pit connecting the top floor of the mushroom to a subteranean chamber. Drogon slows his fall by thrusting a dagger into the wall. The full moon is directly overhead, and below he can see a summoning ritual that three wizards are taking part in, and summoning circle strategically placed beneath the hole.

The wizards succeed in summoning a beholder, but Drogon's presence in the pit ruins the ritual, and the beholder is freed from the wizards control. Drogon falls, bounces off one of the beholder's eye stalks, lands and the floor and scuttles away to hide.  The beholder starts attacking the wizards, and return fire. Within a moment, one wizard is petrified, one is disintegrated, and one is bitten in half and slowly dying on the floor. The beholder is scorched by a massive area-of-effect fire spell, and exits the mushroom by flying through the now open center.

The hole in the mushroom isn't big enough to fit it, but this does not deter the beholder. It errupts, flaming into the night, destroying the structural integrity of the mushroom as it goes. Drogon emerges as the room begins to cool, and witnesses a fourth wizard fly out from behind a curtain.

The wizard is understandably pissed. He says the ritual that was just interupted had taken centuries to put together, and now he has a beholder to track down. He turns to the dying wizard on the floor, utters a word and kills him. Then he flies off chasing down the beholder.
