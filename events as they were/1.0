As it Happened:

	Marvin gave quest as outlined in INTRO.

		The group received the quest, and immediately started snooping around the office.

			They discovered:
				books on a bookshelf,
				a "suspiciously high-quality rug",
				a detailed statue of a warrior in combat.,
				& a desk!
			before Marvin started getting pissy. The went upstairs, but not before 

				Shay helps herself to several cups of wine,
				the others pilfer foods.

			Upstairs the try to interact with the bar patrons, but DM("Will") panics, so they do not. Instead,  Chimeris falls in the mud trying the lift up a barrel, and then the party takes to the road.
		****************************
		The party start their quest.
		****************************

		They stick to the river, as Asteryl knows of a gang of canibals lurks off the road, preying on travelers.


		A quarter of the way, the party finds an abandoned house.
			Kaylee and Asteryl break in. they find some 
				gold, 
				 //were there gems as well?
				a bottle full of mysterious_liquid, and
				& SILVER_DAGGER_WHUT!
		Ni takes SILVER_DAGGER_WHUT!, Asteryl takes mysterious_liquid, and everyone splits the gold.
		They resume traveling.

		Halfway, the party spots group of three fisherman. The party approaches, cautiously. Kaylee asks if the fisherman have any fish or something. She is suddenly attacked from behind. Kaylee gets shot in the leg by a 4th canibal.

		The party attacks!

			Ni kills one canibal as he swims away, begging for mercy. Ni buries his axe in the dudes head.
			Chimeris burned one alive.
			Asteryl OR Ni kills third.
			Kaylee kills last one, her attacker, by stabbing him in the eye with her Rapier.
		Ni collects 4 spears, and the group shares fish? It is highly suggested by DM that these were some canibals. The party continues.

		Three Quarters of the way, party smells a campfire. Shay calls a raven to spy for them. Bird tells her the man at the campfire is a good guy. Shay feeds bird piece of fish, bird flies off.

		The party debates, and approach man with caution.
			Man is Bard. Bard has a super nice bow, and sword. Hey shares his fire, and tells the party he is an assassin or something. He was out on assignment, destabilizing the bandit clan by assassinating their King Dude. Bard does not mention who he was working for. 

		The party has a brief rest, but in the middle of the night, Shay and Asteryl have a huge fight (prolly over Bard). Asteryl throws a cabbage at Shay, who sulks off into the woods.


			In the morning bard cooks some food for everyone that he stole from Chimeris. Then he's gone.

		The group fights a lot, but somehow make their way to the mushroom.
