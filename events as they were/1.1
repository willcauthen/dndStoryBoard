Outside the Mushroom Castle, Chimeris is unconcious, due to poison mushroom toxins of doom, and also Riley not being there.  party finds a bag of gems which includes the CURSED_OPPAL. Kaylee picks up CURSED_OPPAL, and diappears. Drogon emerges from CURSED_OPPAL and is confused.

The group is equally confused, and don't seem to trust Drogon. Drogon claims to be a Diplomat who thieves on the side to support his child, "little Billy Tables." The party remain skeptical, but allow Drogon to accompany them. Asteryl carries the pouch with the CURSED_OPPAL.

Asteryl and Shay are fighting again, a pair of sprites ambush the party from atop a giant mushroom. 
	Ni uses Chimeris's incapacitated body for cover.
	Drogon coats the mushroom and sprites with oil. He succeeds in setting fire to the mushroom one sprite.
	Asteryl shoots one of the sprites.
	Ni grapples the other sprite, breaking its wing, but the sprite breaks free.
	Sprite tries to escape, but Drogon shoots it in the back, and then burns the carcass.

They arrive at the Mushroom Castle, where Drogon claims to have recently been burglarizing. Drogon picks the lock, and party barges in brazenly. As they wander in, a suit of Animated-Armor attacks. The party prevails, after a brief struggle.

Kaylee was in possession of the key, but Drogon succeeds in picking the lock on the Mushroom Tower. In the foyer, the party encounters a suit of animated armor. After a lengthy battle sequence, the party prevails. Chimeris's incapacitated body is used to prop open the door.

The party heads upstairs to the Private quarters. Drogon finds a staff, and experiments with it, succeeding in exploding a chamberpot, coating the quadrant of the room in fecal matter. Shay tries to take a sample from a garden in another quadrant, and inadvertantly activates the evil plants therein. They chase her to to the foyer, before the rest of the party eventually help her by defeating them. 

Here the party gets split. Shay hides outside, refusing to budge. Asteryl wanders around looking at stuff. Drogon gets himself entangled in moss in the center of the mushroom's foyer. He fails the strength check to free, and starts getting pulled into a shaft in the center of the mushroom. Ni helpfully offers to free him by cutting off his entangled limbs. Drogon instead dives in, and all hell breaks loose...
